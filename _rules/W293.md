Blank lines should not contain any tabs or spaces.

### Anti-pattern

**Note:** The `•` character represents a space.

```python
def first_func():
    pass
••••  # This line contains four spaces

def second_func():
    pass
```


### Best practice

```python
def first_func():
    pass


def second_func():
    pass
```
