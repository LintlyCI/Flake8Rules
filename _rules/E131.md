A continuation line is unaligned for hanging indent.

### Anti-pattern

```python
my_dict = {
    "key": "value",
    "long": "the quick brown fox jumps over the "
        "lazy dog",
}
```

### Best practice

```python
my_dict = {
    "key": "value",
    "long": "the quick brown fox jumps over the "
            "lazy dog",
}
```
