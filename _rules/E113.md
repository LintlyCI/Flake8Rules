A line is indented when it shouldn't be. Usually this will mean that multiple lines need to be indented at the same level.

### Anti-pattern

In this example, the two `print` statements do not have matching indentation.

```python
def hello_world():
  print('hello')
    print('world')
```

### Best practice

```python
def hello_world():
    print('hello')
    print('world')
```
