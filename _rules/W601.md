`.has_key()` was deprecated in Python 2. It is recommended to use the `in` operator instead.

### Anti-pattern

```python
my_dict = {'hello': 'world'}
if my_dict.has_key('hello'):
    print('It works!')
```

### Best practice

```python
my_dict = {'hello': 'world'}
if 'hello' in my_dict:
    print('It works!')
```
