A module has been imported twice, and the original import is unused. One of the imports should be removed and you should ensure that it is being used in the file.

### Anti-pattern

In this example, we import `json`, then two lines down we import `json` again.

```python
import json
import os
import json
```

### Best practice

```python
import json
import os
```
