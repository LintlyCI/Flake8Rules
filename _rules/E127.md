A continuation line is indented farther than it should be for a visual indent.

### Anti-pattern

In this example, the string `"World"` is indented two spaces farther than it should be.

```python
print("Python", ("Hello",
                   "World"))
```

### Best practice

```python
print("Python", ("Hello",
                 "World"))
```
