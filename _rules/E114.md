Comment indentation should be a multiple of four.

### Anti-pattern

In the following example, the comment is indented with 5 spaces.

```python
     # 'httpd/unix-directory'
mimetype = 'application/x-directory'
```

### Best practice

```python
    # 'httpd/unix-directory'
mimetype = 'application/x-directory'
```
