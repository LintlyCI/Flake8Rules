A continuation line is under-indented for a visual indentation.

### Anti-pattern

In this example the string `"World"` is under-indented by two spaces.

```python
print("Python", ("Hello",
               "World"))
```

### Best practice

```python
print("Python", ("Hello",
                 "World"))
```
