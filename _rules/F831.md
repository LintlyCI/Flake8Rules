title: "Duplicate argument name in function definition (F831)"
---

Two or more parameters in a function definition have the same name. All names in the function definition should be distinct.

### Anti-pattern

```python
def format_name(first_name, last_name, first_name='Grant'):
    # first_name is declared twice
    pass
```

### Best practice

```python
def format_name(first_name, last_name):
    pass
```
