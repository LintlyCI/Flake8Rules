When comparing a variable to `True`, you should use the form `if x is True` or simply `if x`. The most common incorrect form is `if x == True`.

### Anti-pattern

```python
x = True
if x == True:
    print('True!')
```

### Best practice

```python
x = True
if x is True:
    print('True!')
```

or simply:

```python
x = True
if x:
    print('True!')
```
