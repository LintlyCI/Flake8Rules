Closing brackets should match the same indentation level of the line that their opening bracket started on.

### Anti-pattern

In this example the last line should be indented at the same level as the first line.

```python
result = function_that_takes_arguments(
    'a', 'b', 'c',
    'd', 'e', 'f',
    )
```

### Best practice

```python
result = function_that_takes_arguments(
    'a', 'b', 'c',
    'd', 'e', 'f',
)
```
